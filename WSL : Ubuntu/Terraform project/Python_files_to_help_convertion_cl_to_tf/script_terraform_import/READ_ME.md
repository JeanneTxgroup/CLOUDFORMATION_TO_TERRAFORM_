# Transform CloudFormation Templates into Terraform Imports

This project automates the conversion of AWS infrastructure originally deployed using CloudFormation into Terraform by generating the necessary `terraform import` commands from the `terraform.tfstate` files generated by **Terraformer**.

---

## Features

- Parses all `terraform.tfstate` files under `generated/aws/`
- Executes the Python import script automatically in each Terraformer-generated directory
- Generates `.txt` files containing `terraform import` commands per resource type
- Fully automated via a single shell script

---

## Usage

### 1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have:
- Python 3 installed  
- Terraformer-generated files located under `generated/aws/`
- Your Python script named `script_command_terraform_import.py` at the project root

---

### 2. Run the automation script

Use the provided shell script to run your Python script automatically across all Terraformer directories:

```bash
chmod +x run_import_generators.sh
./run_import_generators.sh

```

If you don't want to use the provided shell you can also run the python script like this 

```bash
python3 script_command_terraform_import.py
```

## Example Output

After execution, youâ€™ll find files like:
generated/aws/security_group/Import for aws_security_group.txt

With content similar to:

Type: aws_security_group        | Name: default                        | ID: sg-0117b2ee24f776302 | Logical Name: tfer--default_sg-0117b2ee24f776302

Type: aws_security_group        | Name: security-group-jeanne          | ID: sg-0e840788dfab7550f | Logical Name: tfer--security-group-jeanne_sg-0e840788dfab7550f

# Terraform import commands:
